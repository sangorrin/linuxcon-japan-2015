File Description
change_page.c: To attack a process with 'pid',
and it will change some instrcution of the running process.

reload_mod.sh: Load the module to attack process

Run:
before you run the following command, you should fisrtly
run the 'monitored-app'
make
./reload_mod.sh

Result:
After running this module, the process with 'pid' will be
attacked and some instruction will be modified by this program.
You can use '$ cmp' command to see the diffierence between
the original app and the modified app.

Example:
original one:
 80481dd:	c6 05 40 63 0c 08 01	movb   $0x1,0x80c6340
 80481e4:	83 c4 14		add    $0x14,%esp
 80481e7:	5b			pop    %ebx
 80481e8:	5d			pop    %ebp
 80481e9:	c3			ret

After run program:
 80481dd:	c6 05 40 63 0c 08 01	movb   $0x1,0x80c6340
 80481e4:	90			nop
 80481e5:	c4 14 5b		les    (%ebx,%ebx,2),%edx
 80481e8:	5d			pop    %ebp
 80481e9:	c3			ret

From above, we could see 0x80481e4 has been modified into 'nop'.
