This folder contains several pieces of proof-of-concept
code that complement my presentation at LinuxCon Japan
2015. They are in experimental status and will probably
require some tweaking from your side depending on the 
environment.

[Note] I tested them in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit, and
       partially in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit

The are provided with no guarantee nor support. You are
free to extend or modify them.
